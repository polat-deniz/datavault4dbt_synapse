## Contributing new features

## We'd love to hear from you

datavault4dbt is in a very early state – we’re constantly adding quality of life improvements and will be adding
new entities and supported databases regularly.
 
If you spot anything you’d like to bring to our attention, have a request for new features, have spotted an improvement we could make, 
or want to tell us about a typo or bug, then please don’t hesitate to let us know via [github](https://github.com/ScalefreeCOM/datavault4dbt/issues). 

We’d rather know you are making active use of this package than hearing nothing from all of you out there! 

Happy Data Vault modeling!

### If it's a feature request, an idea, feedback or a general inquiry
